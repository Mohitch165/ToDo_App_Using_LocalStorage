# 📝 ToDo App Using LocalStorage

A simple yet effective **vanilla JavaScript** To-Do app that lets you add, delete, and mark tasks as complete — with **zero backend** and full use of the browser’s `localStorage`. Perfect for your daily reminders or when you just want to feel productive without actually doing much 😅.

## 🛠️ Customization Ideas

- 🎨 **Custom Themes** — Light mode, dark mode, or "procrastination mode"?
- 🔔 **Notifications** — Remind yourself to stop scrolling and get things done.
- 📅 **Due Dates** — Because "someday" is not a deadline.
- 🧠 **Priority Levels** — Know what’s urgent vs what can wait forever.
